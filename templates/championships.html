        <h1>About F1 Championships</h1>
        <p>F1 runs two championships in parallel: the Drivers' Championship, and the Constructors' Championship<br>
        Drivers will score points based on their race finish, and those points count towards their individual tally and
        are the basis for the Drivers' Standings. At the same time, the team for whom they drive when scoring those points
        gets the same number of points. These two separate points tallies, while connected, are independent: a driver
        switching teams mid-season keeps their points, but so does their old team, and their new team does not gain any
        points.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h2>World Driver's Championship</h2>
                <p>This championship is all about the drivers. This is the one that everyone always talks about. Sometimes
                teams will sacrifice their chance at a Constructors' title if it means their driver will win the Drivers' title,
                like the 2021 season, when Mercedes won the Constructors' title on the last race over Red Bull, but Verstappen won
                the title from Hamilton on the last lap. Mercedes was not celebrating a Constructors' win, while Red Bull were
                celebrating Verstappen's.</p>

                <h2>World Constructor's Championship</h2>
                <p>For better or for worse, this one is mainly about teams getting as much prize money as possible. There don't
                tend to be too many celebrations about a team winning the Constructors', most of the time the winning team also
                has the winning driver. But that doesn't mean this championship doesn't matter. In 2020, the 3-way battle for 3rd
                went down to the last race between Renault (now Alpine), Racing Point (now Aston Martin) and McLaren. And in 2021,
                McLaren and Ferrari were locked in a season-long battle for 3rd. Currently, Ferrari and Mercedes are in a
                battle for 2nd, and McLaren are trying to catch up to Aston Martin for 4th.</p>
                <h3>Current Constructor Standings</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Red Bull Racing - Austria - 597 pts</li>
                        <li>Mercedes AMG - Germany - 289 pts</li>
                        <li>Ferrari - Italy - 265 pts</li>
                        <li>Aston Martin - UK - 217 pts</li>

        <h2>Scoring system</h2>
        <p>The most straight forward thing about F1 is it's scoring system, points are awarded to top finishers the following way:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Finishing position</th>
                <th>Points in Grand Prix</th>
                <th>Points in Sprint</th>
            </tr>

            <!--loops through and builds the table, no need to make it manually-->
            {% for pos in range(0,10) %}
            <tr>
                <td>{{pos + 1}}</td>
                <td>{{gp_points[pos]}}</td>
                <td>{{sprint_points[pos]}}</td>
            </tr>
            {% endfor %}
        </table>

        <p>Additionally, the driver that gets the fastest lap of the race if you get the fastest lap of the race gets and extra point if they are
        in the top 10.</p>

            <h3>Shortened races</h3>
            <p>Sometimes a race is shortened because the conditions are not suitable for racing, or there have been
            too many incidents and stoppages that the race clock has reached 00:00. If that's the case, the following
            points are awarded based on race completion:</p>

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Finishing position</th>
                    <th>Points for 25% distance</th>
                    <th>Points for 50% distance</th>
                    <th>Points for 75% distance</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>

        <h2>Penalties</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Fines</h3>
                Teams and drivers may be fined for racking up penalties, as well as certain breaches of rules, such as interfering
                with cars in Parc FermÃ© - like Verstappen did in Brazil 2021 -> See <a href="/redirect/verstappen_brazil_fined" target="_blank">here</a>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Time Penalties</h3>
                Along with a fine, drivers will often receive time penalties if deemed at fault for incidents during a race.<br>
                Sometimes those are simple time penalties. Sometimes they are required to drive-through the pit lane (without pitting)
                as a penalty. If they decide to serve the penalty, they may do so during pit stops - they have to wait the length
                of their penalty before servicing the car.<br>
                These penalties can also be applied for non-contact incidents, such as speeding in the pit lane, crossing the
                pit lane line (that separates pit entry/exit from the track), unsafe release from pits, and a number of improperly
                carried out procedures regarding race starts, restarts, and safety car periods.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Grid penalties</h3>
                Sometimes drivers get penalties before a race. Sometimes they cause an accident that takes them out of a race. Sometimes
                they use more components (engine, turbo, battery, gearbox) than they are allowed to, or they change it after qualifying.<br>
                When any of these happens, drivers take grid penalties: they start a number of places below where they qualified. Although this
                seems like something to avoid, most drivers take grid penalties due to component changes, and this can lead to some interesting
                races and clever strategy. For instance, if you have the fastest engine on the grid, and you know you'll need it anyway, why not
                take the new component and the penalty at a power-focused track. Fresh engine means more power, and you already have the
                fastest one, so you can fight your way through the field and minimize the damage.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Points deduction</h3>
                Very rarely do drivers or teams break the rules in such a way to warrant a deduction in points. The last instance of this
                came ahead the 2020 British Grand Prix, where Racing Point were deducted 15 points for what the FIA considered a breach
                of the sporting regulations regarding the design of their brake ducts - allegedly being illegally copied from Mercedes.<br>
                Note that these points deductions can be separate for team and drivers: in Racing Point's case, the team lost points,
                but the drivers' kept it, presumably because they had no fault in the design of the car.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Disqualification</h3>
                The rarest of penalties, yet the most severe. The last instance of a team being disqualified was back in 2008, when McLaren
                was caught in a spying scandal that saw them be disqualified from the Constructors' Championship.<br>
                Drivers can also be disqualified from events, with the last instance being Lewis Hamilton being disqualified from qualifying for
                the 2021 SÃ£o Paulo Grand Prix due to a breach of regulations in the rear wing. This didn't mean he couldn't take part in the Sprint Race,
                but he had to start from the back, as if he hadn't qualified at all.
            </li>
        </ol>
            On top of all these penalties, drivers get penalty points on their SuperLicense. If they accumulate 12 points, they are banned
            for the next racing event.
