                F1 events are carried out over 4 days, typically starting on Thursdays.<br>
                Some weekends are regular, and some are Sprint weekends.<br>
                Regular weekends are comprised of 3 Free Practice sessions, Qualifying, and the Grand Prix.<br>
                Sprint weekends are comprised of 1 Free Practice session, Qualifying for the Grand Prix, Sprint Shootout
                (Qualifying for Sprint), Sprint race, and the Grand Prix.<br>

                    After each session, drivers and team principals may speak to media and meet with the team to discuss learnings and
                    apply them to car setup or race strategy.

                <h2>Racing Venues</h2>
                F1 hosts 22 Grand Prix this 2023 season in 20 countries across 5 continents.<br>
                While the majority of the tracks are purpose built tracks, and are certified FIA Grade 1, F1 has slowly
                increased the number of street circuits on the calendar, going from 5 in 2019 to 8 in 2023, and there are talks
                of adding two more in Madrid and London.<br>
                The regulations dictate that F1 circuits be at least 3.5km long, and at most 7km long. All but two circuits fail to
                meet this criteria: the famous Circuit de Monaco, and Circuit de Spa-Francochamps in Belgium. Monaco's
                historic street circuit is only 3.3km in length, but due to its history in F1 is allowed to stay in the calendar. The
                minimum race distance is also not met, with only 79 laps completed for a total of 263km.<br>
                Belgium's Circuit de Spa-Francochamps exceeds the maximum length by 4 meters, being 7.004km in length. Since it also has a
                historic standing in F1, it's also allowed to stay.<br>
                Other curiosities include Mexico City hosting a race at upwards of 7,000 ft. This poses a challenge for both drivers and cars,
                with lack of oxygen affecting both their performance. It also means that high downforce setups are required to achieve
                competitive cornering speeds, and it has minimum impact to straight line speeds.
                <h3>2023 Season:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <!--build table via loop, not manually-->
                    {% for round in range(0,22) %}
                    <li>
                        Round {{round+1}}: {{races[round]}}
                    </li>
                    {% endfor %}
                </ul>

                Some circuits that were removed for this year's calendar include Circuit Paul Ricard in France, Shanghai International Circuit (last seen
                2019), Sochi Autodrom (last seen 2021), or Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari in Italy. This last one was scheduled for this season, but
                rainfall caused the track and surrounding areas to flood. Although the venue was usable for racing, emergency services are
                always required to be on stand-by, and F1 thought it would be better to have them available to those who needed the help, so they
                cancelled the race.

                <h2>Car Parts</h2>
                Without diving into complicated technicalities, F1 teams are limited in how many parts they can use per season.<br>
                A complete power unit is made up of an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE), a Turbo Charger, a Motor-Generator Unit Kinetic (MGU-K),
                a Motor-Generator Unit Heat (MGU-H), a battery (Energy Store), a gearbox, control electronics, and an exhaust system.<br>
                They are allowed 4 ICEs, 4 MGU-Ks, 4 MGU-Hs, 4 TurboChargers, 2 energy stores, 2 control electronics, 8 exhaust systems,
                and 5 gearboxes.<br>
                Within this allocation, teams are allowed to swap components on any car as desired without penalties as long as they swap
                them whilst not in Parc Fermé, which begins when leaving the garage for FP3.
                If a driver decides to change components while on Parc Fermé, they must start the Grand Prix from the pit lane. And if they
                use more components than they are allowed, they incur grid penalties for the closes Grand Prix event following the change.
